            So, this is the start of the end. It's my 3rd day and I already feel like I've got lots to do!!
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll start with my course choices and my reasoning behind them. For 1st semester I have chosen: 
            <br>    - Computer Network Security
            <br>    - Bio Inspired Computing
            <br>    - Data Mining and Machine Learning  
            <br> And for 2nd sem I picked:
            <br>    - Advanced Computer Network Security 
            <br>    - Big Data Management 
        </p>
        <p>
            Cyber security was something I was always interested in when going into university, so much so 
            that I was strongly considering studying ethical hacking at Abertay University. I decided however
            it would probably be best I picked something more broad and less focused, keeping opportunities open
            and I'm glad I went that route. However It's always something I've been into, hence even in first year
            were for one of our courses everyone had to make an android App using MIT's App-inventor, I remember
            the majority of people created little games I felt like the 'odd one out' creating a pretty lame password 
            manager. Um, but anyway yeh thats why I picked both security and adv security. 

            <p>

            AI was something I initially wasn't too interested in until I reached 3rd Year were we did an intro to AI course.
            After learning about how important it is and will be, I was hooked and wanted to learn so much more than what 
            the course originally taught. It was both fun and very challenging and it reminded me of why I wanted to study computer science
            in the first place.
            </p>
        <p>
            With these course choices in mind, I have the option to get a degree with a specialism in AI or Cyber Security, 
            or just leave uni with a standard CS degree. This all depends on my final year dissertation...
        </p>

        <p>
            About the final year dissertation I'm trying to do something related to the covid-19 pandemic. Nothing confirmed or 
            detailed yet, just throwing some ideas here and there. However I feel like it would be good, fun and interesting to 
            do something that's relevant to current scenarios. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Anyway 
            <br>

        <div id="hidden-content">
            <div class="clickFIrstAutomatedBlogEntry">
                <h1>First Automated Blog Entry</h1>
                <h3>July 06, 2020, 00:20</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="expandFIrstAutomatedBlogEntry">
                <p>
                    Well semi automated at best.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ok, I know its been a couple of days again, don't mind me, just taking lil breaks here nd there no
                    biggie. <br> Anyway stuff ive done over the last few days are again mainly website related, first I
                    added more pics to my setup page, I still need to finish it, might just bash it out tomorrow, its not
                    really even that important I just like me some of that technology stuff ygm? idk just thought it made this Website
                    feel a little more personal, but it's just kinda turned into a place where I flex all my stuff. oh well it iz what it iz.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway going back to the point, also added a site tracker to see how much traffic I've been getting on 
                    this website. you Get to see some cool statistics such as what devices people are using and what country everyone is from. It's pretty 
                    cool wont lie. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    And finally the blog page automation. It's pretty simple really, a python script that appends some JS and CSS and also rewrites the blog.html
                    to insert some HTML boilerplate in the middle of the file. (on line 90 to be specific). Nothing special but I will carry on working on it so
                    eventually I wont have to touch my blog.html file and everything Will either be done on a separate markdown file or via a python user interface that I'll 
                    eventually create. Planning on making the python script an exe because permissions are a fkn pain in windows compared to linux. you can check out the 
                    python script <a href="https://github.com/amaan-akram/AddBlogpost">here</a>. It also auto gens the time stamps and so on so forth, you might have noticed
                    the change in the order of my date stamps.... anyway. That's that.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So yeah, as shops start to open, im going to be spending less time indoors which means less time coding. That is during the day anyway. I still need to get back on
                    flutter development, I've decided what my first project is going to be and it's something that my father asked me to create, so will be pretty cool to actually have a 
                    piece of software that someone actually needs to use day to day. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    But yeh until the next time that is me off. Night
                </p>

                <p>
                    oh btw did you notice the cool lil scroll bar?
                </p>

                    <p>
                        Ok its been a while, took a bit of a break, again. can't blame me its the holidays and the
                        weather has been niceeee, can't be wasting good days like that in scotland.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Okay! so I kinda sorted out my blog page, its a bit messy but kinda works, so immma keep it like
                        this until I find something better. It does require me to manually add divs with unique
                        numbering, but either ill automate it orrrr ill just find a new way
                        to do it all. Preferably the blogs would all just be written in MD. Ill figure it out
                        eventually, for now what I have is pretty cool. Also fixed up the cards on the setup page and
                        just created a general template/layout of how everything
                        is gonna be set. currently working on the mobile nav bar, it's kind meh rn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Im gonna hop back on Flutter & dart development soooon, I was really enjoying the process of
                        learning it. Ive had many project ideas during my initial time I spent learning which is a
                        really good sign. Im just finding a balancing of enjoying my time off
                        and learning. Afterall this is technically my last ever summer holidays I will ever have.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also quick shout out to the homie <a href="https://alak.bar/">Alakbar</a> who featured me on his
                        page, he has a pretty dope website and was super nice of him to add me in like that. It's also
                        kinda my motivation to make my website
                        more complete and at a half finished state atleast.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So yeh, not too productive overall, been out taking pictures and going on lil drives. Idk corona
                        got me a bit messed up
                    </p>

                    This is the ends.

                    <p>
                        Ok, Good Morning, I created my first Flutter app and coded in dart for the first time!! I've
                        learned a lot but also slightly overwhelmed by how different it is to code in dart, especially
                        since I've only really done front end coding in HTML/CSS.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So following the tutorial from the <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install">
                            Fluter docs</a> I created an app that randomly generates startup company names by taking a
                        random pair of popular words in the English language
                        and displaying them in an infinite list view, This was done using an open source package called
                        <a href "https://pub.dev/packages/english_words">english_words</a>. (btw just looking through
                        all the open source packages available on <a href="https://pub.dev/">pub.dev</a> is getting me
                        hyped). I extended the app to allow the
                        user to save a word pair in the case they liked it.
                        <a href="https://github.com/amaan-akram/CompanyNameGen"> Link to app on github </a>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So, some things I noted with Flutter, as i've said before it is pretty different from anything
                        else I have used to code with especially it's structure:
                        <br>Everything is based around what they call 'widgets'. so the text on an app is a widget the
                        padding surrounding the text is a widget, the title bar of the app is a widget and the whole app
                        itself is a widget.
                        <br> So far from what I can tell there are two different types of widgets;
                        <b>Stateless Widgets</b> - which are immutable so typically used for fixed variables such as
                        titles or colors, and
                        <b>Stateful widgets</b> - which typically expect some sort of change to occur within the
                        application. When creating a Stateful widget however, two classes must be created; first a
                        StatefulWidget class that creates an instance of
                        a State class which is the second class you create. So actually the StatefulWidget class itself
                        is immutable but the State class itself stays alive during the lifetime of that widget! Yea ik
                        kinda confusing but its ok, we move
                        thanks to VScode's flutter extension I can quickly generate boiler plate code to do all this for
                        me :)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Something cool about flutter is how easy it is to test and develop full on native applications
                        that are automatically cross platform, for starters simply plugging in my phone via usb to my
                        computer allows me to test my app on my actual device! pretty
                        cool. Also it's ability to test on cross platform is crazy to me, I can run it natively an IOS
                        emulator, run it on my physical android phone, but also run it as a web app on my browser?? (<a
                            href="https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web">beta</a>).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Anyway yeh thats what I did yesterday, today im going to carry on with Flutter development and
                        create more apps! Later on I might include code examples and talk through them rather than just
                        being a giant wall of text, I still need to organize this page,
                        lmfao ill do it one day. Anyway its a really nice day outside so im gonna go out and enjoy the
                        sun
                    </p>
                    bye bye losers.

                    <p>Ok, so i didn't do much yesterday woops, well I did stuff just nothing cs related, but
                        today/tomorrow will be the start of my flutter stuff, I've fully setup flutter on my desktop,
                        and now im going to setup on my laptop before I sleep,
                        and tomorrow morning i will create my first flutter app, probably just a note taking app or some
                        sort of planner. either way i will learn!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also considering redesigning this website to something a little less serious, or I might just
                        move this blog somewhere else, especially because it's more for me rather than other people. oh
                        well just gonna see what happens. maybe work on this website
                        in-between working on flutter stuff, sounds like a good plan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also decided to dual boot linux on my laptop rather than committing to one thing like i usually
                        do. Reason for this is I like to edit my photos on my laptop sometimes and I use products from
                        adobe so Windows is kinda necessary for me. But I've decided
                        to choose ubuntu, ive tinkered with other distorts before, even dabbling into Arch and i3 fully
                        customizing everything taking inspiration form r/unixporn (if you are unfamiliar it is sfw dw).
                        But i feel like now i need something
                        stable and popular as I need to focus on my projects rather than the tools im using. Just pick
                        something that works and stick with it, no more tinkering no more fixing :)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Final thing, I need to add that banner thingy on this page kinda like the setup page, keep the
                        theme consistent. Also need to figure out a better way to organize each blog entry hmmmmmmmm
                    </p>

                    Goodnight.
