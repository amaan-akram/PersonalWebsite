      <h1>Starting with flutter</h1>
      <h3>23st June 2020 23:46</h3>
      <p>Ok, so i didn't do much yesterday woops, well I did stuff just nothing cs related, but today/tomorrow will be the start of my 
        flutter stuff, I've fully setup flutter on my desktop, and now im going to setup on my laptop before I sleep, and tomorrow morning i 
      will create my first flutter app, probably just a note taking app or some sort of planner. either way i will learn!</p>
      <p>
        Also considering redesigning this website to something a little less serious, or I might just move this blog somewhere else, especially because it's more for me 
        rather than other people. oh well just gonna see what happens. maybe work on this website in-between working on flutter stuff, sounds like a good plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also decided to dual boot linux on my laptop rather than committing to one thing like i usually do. Reason for this is I like to edit my photos on my laptop sometimes and I use
        products from adobe so Windows is kinda necessary for me. But I've decided to choose ubuntu, ive tinkered with other distorts before, even dabbling into Arch and i3 fully 
        customizing everything taking inspiration form r/unixporn (if you are unfamiliar it is sfw dw). But i feel like now i need something stable and popular as I need to focus on 
        my projects rather than the tools im using. Just pick something that works and stick with it, no more tinkering no more fixing :)
      </p>

      <p>
        Final thing, I need to add that benner thingy on this page kinda like the setup page, keep the theme consistent. Also a better way to organize each blog entry
        hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
      </p>
     
      Goodnight.
      <br>
      PS Yaseen i sry :C

      <h1>First Blog Entry</h1>
      <h3>21st June 2020 01:54</h3>
      <p>Ok, so this website is currently a mess right now, however, I really need to start getting my sh- together, I have just quit working at Amazon
        as a 'fulfillment associate' (Sounds cooler than it actually is). Now it's time to get back into coding, finally. So uh ill make a list, and hopefully update any progress?
        idk how this whole blog thing works but meh here we go:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Learn flutter </li>
        <li>create a few apps maybe?</li> 
        <li>Mobile friendly this website pls </li>
        <li>Do more stuff in Go </li>
        <li>Brush up on OOP concepts </li>
        <li>Brush up on data structures and algs </li>
        <li>Consider migration to go-macaron or hugo </li>
        <li>Fix up this website </li>
        <li>Oh yeh fix up this website </li>
        <li>Switch to linux again lol</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        Also need to start thinking about what im going to do for my final year project, that will be though. Anyway doubt anyone will read this just needed to throw my thoughts 
        out there somewhere, heads been all over the place recently. List will most likely be more refined as the days go on...
        </p>

        <br> Goodnight. 
        <br> ps yaseen stop being annoying
